Assume that the goal nodes are F, G, and H.
B) Here are the implementations and results for UCS, Best First Greedy, and A* search:

UCS (Uniform Cost Search)
Order of nodes visited: A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H

Solution path: A -> B -> F

Explanation: UCS expands the nodes in order of increasing cost. 
It starts at A, expands to B and C with cost 1, then to D with cost 2, then to E with cost 3, 
then to F with cost 4, then to G and H with cost 5. The goal nodes are reached in the order F, G, H, 
but the lowest-cost path to a goal node is A -> B -> F with cost 4.

Best First Greedy
Order of nodes visited: A, B, E, F

Solution path: A -> B -> F

Explanation: Best First Greedy expands the nodes in order of their heuristic function values, 
which estimate the cost of reaching a goal node from the current node. In this case, the heuristic 
function is the Euclidean distance between the current node and each of the goal nodes. 
It starts at A, which is closest to F, and expands to B and E, which are closest to F and G, 
respectively. Then it expands to F, which is a goal node. The solution path is the same as UCS.

A* search
Order of nodes visited: A, B, C, D, F, G, H

Solution path: A -> B -> F

Explanation: A* search expands the nodes in order of their f-value, 
which is the sum of the cost of reaching the current node from the start node 
and the heuristic function value of the current node. In this case, the heuristic function is the same as Best First Greedy. It starts at A, expands to B and C with f-value 1, then to D with f-value 2, then to F with f-value 5, then to G and H with f-value 6. The goal nodes are reached in the order F, G, H, but the lowest-cost path to a goal node is A -> B -> F with cost 4, which is also the same as UCS and Best First Greedy.


C) Here are the implementations and results for Depth-First Search, Breadth-First Search, and Iterative Deepening Depth-First Search:

Depth-First Search (DFS)
Order of nodes visited: A, B, E, F, C, G, D, H

Solution path: A -> B -> E -> F

Explanation: DFS explores the graph by going as far as possible along each branch before backtracking. It starts at A, goes to B, then to E, and reaches F, which is a goal node. Then it backtracks to B and explores the other branch by going to C, then to G, and finally to D and H. The solution path is A -> B -> E -> F.

Breadth-First Search (BFS)
Order of nodes visited: A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H

Solution path: A -> B -> F

Explanation: BFS explores the graph by expanding the shallowest unexplored node first. 
It starts at A, expands to B, C, and D with cost 1, then to E, F, G, and H with cost 2. 
The goal nodes are reached in the order F, G, H, but the lowest-cost path to a goal node is 
A -> B -> F with cost 4.

Iterative Deepening Depth-First Search (IDDFS)
Order of nodes visited: A, B, E, F, C, G, D, H

Solution path: A -> B -> E -> F

Explanation: IDDFS is a combination of DFS and BFS that gradually increases the depth limit 
of DFS until a goal node is found. It starts with a depth limit of 1, which is equivalent to BFS, 
and expands to A, B, C, D, E, F, G, and H. Then it increases the depth limit to 2, which is equivalent 
to DFS, and expands to A, B, E, F, C, G, D, and H. It finds the solution path A -> B -> E -> F at this depth. 
Finally, it increases the depth limit to 3 and explores the entire graph, but the solution has already been found at depth 2. 
The order of nodes visited is the same as DFS.
