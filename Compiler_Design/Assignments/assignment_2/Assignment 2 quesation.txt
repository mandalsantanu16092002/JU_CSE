a) Write a program that will accept a 'C' code as input, perform lexical analysis and output a stream of tokens with lexemes, 
tokens and the position of each token in the 'C' code.

b) Output any lexical error in the 'C' code.

c) A token may appear several times in the code. For example, an identifier 'sum' 
may appear in the declaration statement, in multiple assignment statements like "sum = a+b;" 
or "result = sum + z;" or in conditional statements. 
The tokens need to be stored in a symbol table. You need to store the token using an 
efficient data structure, such that insertion and searching from the data structure become efficient.
Which data structure have you used in your code? What are the time complexities of 
insertion and search for a token?
