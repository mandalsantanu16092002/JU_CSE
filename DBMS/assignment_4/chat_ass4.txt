Assuming you have an EMP table with columns emp_id and emp_name, 
you can use the following SQL query to find the name of an employee given their code:

sql

SELECT emp_name FROM EMP WHERE emp_id = <employee code>;
Replace <employee code> with the actual code entered by the user.
 
If the employee with the given code does not exist in the table, 
the query will return an empty result set. You can check for this case 
in your application code and display an appropriate error message to the user.



To accept an employee code from the user in SQL, 
you can use the DECLARE and SET statements to create a variable and assign it 
the value entered by the user. Here's an example:

sql

DECLARE @emp_code varchar(10)
SET @emp_code = 'employee_code'

Replace 'employee_code' with the actual code entered by the user. 
The varchar(10) specifies that the variable @emp_code is a string with a 
maximum length of 10 characters. You can adjust this to match the length 
of your employee code field in the EMP table.

Note that in most cases, you would want to prompt the user for the employee code 
instead of hardcoding it in the SQL script. Depending on the environment in which 
you're running the SQL script (e.g., SQL Server Management Studio, a command line tool, 
a web application), the method for prompting the user may vary.
